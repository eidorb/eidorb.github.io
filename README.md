This is a static website. 
Its html was generated by a marimo notebook (Python).
That's pretty normal.

But it's only the _files_ that are static -- 
this html is [_WASM-powered_](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/exporting/#export-to-wasm-powered-html)!

This static website runs a Python web app in the browser. 
The web app uses requests, a _Python library_, to pull information from GitHub's API.

This application isn't especially useful.
But it's wonderful that it can exist.

Edit locally:
